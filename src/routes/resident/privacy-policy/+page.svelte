(“Lutendi”, “us”, “we”, “our”) owns and operates the website located at www.lutendi.com (“Website”) and the Lutendi rent reporting platform (“Platform” and together with Website, “Services”). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose information, including personally identifiable information about an individual (“Personal Information”), which we collect or receive via the Services. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding Personal Information of Users who access and browse the Website or use the Platform.
    </div>
    <div class="pb-5">
        We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. Lutendi may require you to provide consent to the updated Privacy Policy before further use of the Services is permitted. 
    </div>
    <div class="pb-5">
        <span class="font-bold">1. Who does this Privacy Policy apply to? </span>With respect to Platform Users, this Privacy policy applies to partners with whom we have executed a separate master subscription agreement (each, a “Partner”) and to individuals who have entered into a rental agreement with a Partner (each, a Resident” and collectively with Partner, “User”, “you”, “your”). We may receive Personal Information about Residents directly from Partners and this Privacy Policy will apply to such Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information by Partners. Partners may be subject to differing requirements that govern how they collect, use, and disclose a Resident’s Personal Information. We encourage Residents to read the Partner’s respective privacy policy or to contact the Partner directly to understand how Personal Information may be collected, used, and disclosed by that Partner.

            Lutendi Systems Inc. (“Lutendi”, “us”, “we”, “our”) owns and operates the website located at www.lutendi.com (“Website”) and provides the rent reporting services, as described on the Website (“Services”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to individuals who have entered into a property rental agreement (“Lease”) with a Landlord (defined below) and would like to register for the Services (“User”, “you”, “your”). 
        </div>
        <div class="pb-5">
            Please note that if you are a landlord who would like to access the Services (“Landlord”), separate terms will govern your use of the Services.

        <div class="pb-5">
            By clicking a checkbox to indicate acceptance of these Terms or by using the Services, you indicate that you have read and accepted these Terms, which constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Lutendi. If you do not accept these Terms, then do not use the Services. You are not permitted to accept these Terms or use the Services on behalf of another individual or entity.

If we make changes to these Terms, we will notify you by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms, providing a notice via the Services, and/or by sending you an email (as appropriate). Following such revisions, Lutendi may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms before continuing to use the Services. Any material revisions to these Terms shall become effective thirty (30) days following the date of the notice and your acceptance of the revised Terms or decision to continue using the Services thereafter (as applicable) shall constitute your acceptance of such revised Terms. If you do not agree to any such revisions, your only recourse is to stop using the Services.

        <div class="pb-5">
            <span class="font-bold">1. About the Services. </span>The Services enable the reporting of User rental payments on behalf of their Landlords to credit bureaus with whom Lutendi has a contractual relationship (each, a “Credit Bureau”). By reporting your rental payment history, you have the opportunity to build and maintain a positive credit history. Lutendi uses bank level (AES-256) encryption standards to ensure that your data is secure from end-to-end. Lutendi provides a streamlined integration designed to transform the rental landscape. Every month, User rental payments are automatically updated on their Credit Bureau credit report. Users may also use the Services to dispute rental payment transactions between their Landlords.
            <br><br>
            <span class="font-bold">NOTE: </span>Use of the Services is voluntary and not a prerequisite of your Lease.
